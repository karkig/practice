/*
Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.
And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2.

Approach
1. If you iterate loop from front then you have to run n*n times.
2. Iterate reverse loop. Scan all the elements from right to left in an array and keep track of maximum till now. When maximum changes its value, print it.
